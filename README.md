# bootcamp

Computing bootcamp for summer interns at the Fermilab CPC. The goal of this bootcamp is to be an interactive introduction to scientific computing and *not* an exhaustive resource on the topics covered. The session have been designed so that they can be executed on Google Colab; however, the material is not intended to be specific to Colab. 

The bootcamp is roughly broken into two sessions.

* Session 1: Introductory - Linux, shell, Python, notebooks, git
* Session 2: Intermediate - data analysis, visualization, fitting, markov chain monte carlo

Each session is expected to last ~2 hours.

Enjoy!
