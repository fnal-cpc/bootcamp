# Fermilab CPC Computing Bootcamp

This is a computing bootcamp for summer interns at the Fermilab CPC. The goal of this bootcamp is to be an interactive introduction to scientific computing and *not* an exhaustive resource on the topics covered. The session have been designed so that they can be executed on Google Colab; however, the material is not intended to be specific to Colab. 

The bootcamp is roughly broken into two sessions.

* Session 1: Introductory 
  * [Linux and the shell](LinuxShell.ipynb)
  * [Python and notebooks](Python/Intro_to_Python.ipynb)
  * [Git and GitHub](Git)
* Session 2: Intermediate
  * [Visualization](python_visualization)
  * [Pandas](Pandas.ipynb)
  * [Model fitting](Model_Fitting_in_Python.ipynb)
  * [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](mcmc.ipynb)

Each session is expected to last 2 hours. Abundant additional material is provided as references.

Enjoy!
